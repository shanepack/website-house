# This is a test for PixiJS to display animated sprites on a web page.

The waving guy and the house behind him are separate sprites on a sheet.

The site can be viewed here: https://shanepack.github.io/website-house/index.html

Note that it is not set up to display properly outside of 16:9 displays.
