# This is my EPIC website's BEGINNING!

yeah, we're gonna get pretty crazy with this one...

### TO-DO List:

- Center the application / up-res the house sprite              (Might be best to set the background to white and make the house an animatedSprite seperate from the background.)
- Fill the application on the entire window, scaling using:     (app.renderer.resize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);)
- Create sprites for individual buttons around the house        (About Me, Resume, Projects)
